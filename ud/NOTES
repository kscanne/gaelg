ta/va used as a copula?  Sentences aa_003, aa_005, aa_037 (tok 22), aa_039 "ta shen", aa_044 "dy ve nearey foshlit" = "chun bheith (i do) náire oscailte"?, aa_057 (similar to aa_005 in structure, but without explicit copula "is é sin a bhí..."), aa_064 (cre ta my hie = cad é mo theach/theaghlach), aa_075 (similar to aa_057), aa_077 "ta'n doonaght", aa_081 (a bit like aa_064, "quoi vees ny cosneyderyn" = "cé a bheidh na buaiteoirí", which in true Irish would be "ina mbuaiteoirí" or "cé iad na buaiteoirí"), aa_089 "dy beigns y mooadys kiart" (if I had been the right size... Ir. has "an mhéid cheart *ionam*"), aa_164 "dy row eh eairkag", aa_180 (cre ta'n Courey == cad é an comhartha), aa_234 "Is é a chleachtadh..."?

reported speech; ccomp vs. parataxis (e.g. aa_022 since speech verb comes first and b/c of quotes/colon), or reversed parataxis (e.g. aa_001 because speech verb is in the middle).

Notes on individual sentences
==========

aa_023
Searching "named" + PROPN in English shows most of the PROPN's get xcomp pointing back to "named"; see e.g. "I have a parakeet named Cookie", Cookie is xcomp of "named", or "A hottie named Joby".  Some are "obj" though....
enmysit; (see also aa_092, aa_116)  enmyssit

aa_041
chur sarey (see Ir. ordú chun seilbh d'fháil; xcomp of "ordú")

aa_043
and its responsibility ná ...   See Irish 1867 "an rud a chuir ionadh is alltacht orm ná"

aa_053
de ve + ADJ ADJ; both get xcomp:pred, see Ir. treebank "réabtha dóite"

aa_060
er y fa...  following clause is "acl"; this is a classic "content clause" since it modifies the noun "fa", similar to clauses following "the fact that", "the idea that.." etc. but not an acl:relcl since there's no omitted role in the clause for "fa"

and the tricky "gyn y skeeal çheet..."  without the story becoming...
The trick here is that "gyn" connects to "çheet", not "y skeeal";
was hard to find an analogue in EN; but see 
answers-20111108111010AASEk0S_ans-0013 
"...(worried) about the snake burning itself"
about correctly modifies burning, etc.

aa_066
"marish ny braghtyn" as part of the subject is treated as an nmod in EN; see
"The test, along with an information form, is available at"

aa_067
ny shlee na...
Following English here since Irish seems wrong (CCONJ?)
"ná" is surely an ADP here, but English uses "fixed" to link to the preceding
comparative adjective.

aa_068
"shey meeilaghyn my yiass"; see English "one mile west of you";
west is an advmod modifying "one mile", same analysis in Irish
"timpeall ceithre mhíle siar ón mbaile."  (and the "ón mbaile" an nmod too)
cf aa_251

aa_069
"mongey" here could be either obj (regular noun) or xcomp (verbal noun);
corpus is split between cases where it's unambiguously one or the other!

aa_071  similar issue with "reill" to mongey, and here I think
one of the two is more vn-like than the other (b/c of the
"un vlein jeig" as an nmod)

aa_073
c'raad va...  (Ir. cad é an áit a bhfuil... nó cén áit a bhfuil)
See Ir. examples like "chuig an áit a bhfuil Teach an Phosta...";
acl:relcl with "Teach an Phosta" as the subject

aa_076
This is Psalms 136:16. The subject (Dia?) is omitted here and in most
of the verses going back to 136:4; think of there being an "a" before them;
"(Dia) a rinne a phobal féin a threorú tríd an bhfásach..."

aa_077
Could read this as "ach (is) ar an seachtú lá atá an Domhnach"
but looking at GA/EN, the "ta'n doonaght" is a parenthetical identifying
the seventh day...

aa_081 Good example (I think) of a big appos NP.... sort of "resumptive" pronoun subject in the main clause.. but maybe it's just parataxis?  cf. aa_103

aa_086 I think this is an example (as noted in the docs for "conj") where the annotation scheme doesn't capture the full coordinated structure; simplified example in English equivalent to it:
"I played with Kevin on Tuesday and with Maddy on Wednesday"
the four PPs are all obl of the verb; no way to represent that the 
first two and second two "go together".

aa_104; not sure about tag on token 18 "ta"...
not finding any parallel examples in en or ga...  
"more than is needed/necessary"; the construction in Ir is usually
"níos mó ná mar atá..." but those have the atá as advcl pointing 
too far back IMO....

aa_106  as/agus as a SCONJ; "agus iad ag iompar..."
See https://universaldependencies.org/ga/dep/mark.html for what Irish does;
as is a SCONJ+mark, points to following pronoun, and that pronoun is the
head (probably pointing to some higher clause as an advcl), and the VN
is xcomp of the PRON. See also aa_161.

aa_106 and aa_110 are first examples of "raad" as an ADV, which 
I've tagged just like English "where"  (the place *where* he ate...)
verb (ate) is acl:relcl point back to the noun (place)

aa_113  "by what power I do..." is tricky, hard to find parallel examples
cf Eng.  You do not understand with whom you are dealing.
since "by what power..." is the object of "I will tell" which is why
"with whom you are dealing" gets ccomp, I think....

aa_118  "X a dhéanamh sásta"; adj get xcomp, cf. English 
"we're making the ocean pretty unhappy"

aa_122
strange transitive use of the verb tar/haink!

aa_123  note handling of stiagh_ayns as a unit; otherwise they
are both independent modifiers of the verb which doesn't really work

aa_130  ó X go Y handled differently in different places in Irish;
sometimes the Y is nmod of the X, other times both are co-equal obliques
of some higher verb; generally the latter in English treebanks although
I see some phrases of the first time, "from time to time", maybe
based on the idiomatic nature they should be bound together?

Also, really unsure of the tag on token 21 (va) in "by vessey foast ny va ry heet" == "ba mheasa fós a raibh le teacht"; the PRON "a" not there in the Manx; in Irish I'd make that the nsubj of the copula and the verb as an acl of that, I guess?!

aa_135  sweet long distance dependency  from token 2 to its xcomp at 23

aa_137  crazy sentence with no main verb;  NP, ADVCL, CCOMP;
comes down to how to handle token 3 and token 19; one is root, other is ????
Not unhappy with current analysis; basically no main verb,
the ADVCL in the middle is clearly that and can be ignored, rest of the
sentence paraphrases in English as one big NP:
"These things that I'm after telling you so that you're able to 
remember that I told you them", which is weirdly vacuous, too.

aa_140
main clause starting at 12 (bee) doesn't have a predicate; should
I change token 3 to xcomp:pred?  cf the Irish with similar word order,
but notice they graft the bit about pillars to the main clause with le!

aa_166 (see also aa_256)
"cha nee" is a negative copula, but UD doesn't allow any
words to modify a copula (so "cha" can't point to "nee" as a mark).
There's only one example of a similar modifier of the copula in the 
Irish treebank (because in virtually every case the negative particle
combines with the copula into one word); "dá mba mise" in sentence 
432, and there Teresa has the "dá" pointing to the subject
(same as where the cop points). Not sure if that's a hack but it at
least avoids the warning. 

aa_174; copula word order is opposite of Irish;
cre ny lhottyn ad shoh = cad na créachta iad seo
where we'd expect   cad iad na créachta seo

aa_175  gaase ro shenn, like aa_118, adj gets xcomp

aa_199  "NOUN mooie er close y scoill" 
Treat "mooie er" like "NOUN out of NOUN" in English,
so mooie points to close as "case", and "er" points back to mooie as fixed

aa_218
ny s'gilley na sniaghtey;
English corpus handles "more ADJ than NOUN" as I did here, 
"na sniaghtey" being a normal PP, with the noun pointing back to ADJ
as obl.  ny and s' are particles; I used fixed in this unusual 
case that the s' is separated by apost

aa_220
Usage of "feme" as a verbal noun. Usage examples stick closely with 
Irish idioms where "gá" would work as a translate;
ta feme rish X
tá feme echey er X  (ir. would have le here too, but whatevs)
This sentence uses is more like "ag teastáil"; at first I thought it 
might be an error by a modern writer but now I see examples like
this in the Bible:
nagh vel mee feme nhee erbee
dy row ad feme cooney 'sy whaiyll
dy vel shiu feme dy chooilley nhee 
...
So I'm treating this and all similar usages as xcomp and the ones 
closer to Irish as normal NOUN (nsubj)

aa_251
ina luí 45km taobh thuaidh ó
See eg. English "500 islands lying 1,000 kilometers east of Sri Lanka"
A bit different since "east" is an ADV in English treebank, but I've
followed the general approach making distance "1000 km" is an obl
modifying "east" (basically, you could leave it out and it's still fine).
And for me, since "çheu hwoaie" is an NP and not an ADV, it's an obl
modifying "ny lhie".  cf. aa_068


aa_254 (see also aa_268 where it's X, Contae na hIarmhí)
Coontae Shliggee, Nerin...   English corpus uses appos for the
state in "City, State" pairs, see "Cambridge, Massachusetts" e.g.

The (Baarle: Garavogue River) is tricky too... .fortunately there are
other WP-looking examples in English treebank, search e.g.
"(French: I'ile Papillon)"

aa_256 see aa_166 re: "dy nee"

aa_274  First real hard ellipsis case, requiring orphan deprel
if I'm reading the spec correctly.

ab_000  trooid y vyghin er ny hoilshaghey diuish;
no clear parallel in Irish; best are examples like
"trí NOUN a chur ..."  Irish treebank has trí as ADP/case of the NOUN,
NOUN as the obj of chur, and chur as an advcl of the higher clause

ab_002; note jeianagh advmod of Romanagh and not amod of noun; that 
seems to be a common mistake in English treebank:
genuine borderline cases
early classical N
so-called predatory journals

ab_004;  mixed handling of month/day/year in English treebank;
I've followed Irish and just made it flat; the "(Nalbin)" is 
treated as an appos following sentid=email-enronsent16_01-0044 in 
English treebank

ab_011 lit. translation not grammatical in Irish;
I'm treating "rere y sorçh..." as the predicate which sounds weird
