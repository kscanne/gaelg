Process for adding new data

$ rm -f corpus.txt

# Assign a new $batch_name in ig2draft.pl (aa,ab,ac,...,az,ba,bb,...)
# Edit BATCH in makefile to number of sentences desired

# build new corpus.txt, then ig-output.txt, then draft.tsv, then edit.tsv:

$ make edit.tsv

Manually correct the POS tags in column 3 (best guess made already).

Pay attention to tokenization of 3rd person masc. pronomials:
ass, da, er, fo, jeh, jee, lesh, marish, ree, rish, roish, veih, voish.

Add Irish or English translations in comments as appropriate.

$ make tagged.tsv

Look through and remove all (?) and (!) flags next to stems;
(?) = multiple possible stems for this token/POS pair
(!) = no stem available in DB; left unchanged
Helps to have tagdict.tsv open for the ambiguous cases...

If stems look good and ready to parse:

$ make pedit.tsv

Go through pedit.tsv and add heads/syntactic relations throughout.

Then run UD's validation script on the new sentences:
$ bash test.sh -p

Once tests pass, this will append pedit.tsv to gold.tsv 
and rebuild the .conllu file (and gold-corpus.txt)

$ make append

Just to be 100% sure, can rerun validation on whole gold file again:

$ bash test.sh -g

If it *really* looks good

$ make clean
